# TensorFramework

TensorFramework is a tool for automated tensor calculation and simplification. This tool provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to input tensor expressions, perform various tensor operations, and save/load expressions.

## Features

- Symbolic tensor algebra operations
  - Simplification
  - Contraction
  - Addition
  - Multiplication
- Save and load tensor expressions
- Interactive GUI for user input and output

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd TensorFramework
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    # Linux / macOS
    virtualenv tensor_env
    source tensor_env/bin/activate

    # Windows
    python -m venv tensor_env
    .\tensor_env\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```

## Usage

- Enter tensor expressions in the input area.
- Select an operation from the dropdown menu.
- Click "Calculate" to perform the operation.
- View the result in the output area.
- Click "Save" to save the current tensor expression to a file.
- Click "Load" to load a tensor expression from a file.
